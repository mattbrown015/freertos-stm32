FreeRTOS investigation using STM32 32L0538DISCOVERY.

# Introduction

I'm considering using FreeRTOS for an embedded project.  I happened to have a STM32 32L0538DISCOVERY hanging around so thought I would use it and OpenSTM32 to do some investigation.

I'm new to FreeRTOS, STM32, OpenSTM32 and GitHub so the whole thing is an adventure.
